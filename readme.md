# FastAPI with MySQL Example

This project demonstrates how to create a FastAPI application with a MySQL database backend using SQLAlchemy. The project includes Docker configurations to run the application and database in separate containers.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and Docker Compose installed
- MySQL installed locally (optional if you want to run MySQL locally)

## Setup and Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fastapi-mysql-example.git
cd fastapi-mysql-example
2. Create a .env File
Create a .env file in the project root directory with the following content:

dotenv
Copy code
DATABASE_URL=mysql+pymysql://talib:talibPass@localhost/items
3. Install Python Dependencies
If you are running the application locally (not using Docker), install the dependencies using pip:

sh
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Running with Docker
Build and start the Docker containers:

sh
Copy code
docker-compose up --build
5. Running Locally
Ensure MySQL is running on your local machine and accessible at localhost. Then, start the FastAPI application:

sh
Copy code
uvicorn main:app --reload
Usage
Create an Item
sh
Copy code
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/items/" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Sample Item"}'
Get Items
sh
Copy code
curl "http://localhost:8000/items/"
Stopping the Application
With Docker
To stop the Docker containers, run:

sh
Copy code
docker-compose down
Locally
If running locally, stop the FastAPI server with CTRL+C in the terminal where it's running.

Troubleshooting
Common Issues
MySQL Connection Error: Ensure that your MySQL server is running and accessible.
Docker Issues: Make sure Docker is installed and running. Verify the Docker Compose file is correctly set up.
Conclusion
This FastAPI project demonstrates how to integrate with a MySQL database using SQLAlchemy. The Docker setup makes it easy to deploy and manage the application. Feel free to extend the application with more features and endpoints as needed.
